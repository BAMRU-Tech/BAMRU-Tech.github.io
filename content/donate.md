subtitle = "When a member of our community goes missing, it’s hard to imagine the immense effort that goes into bringing that person back to their family. Our purpose is to ensure that we bring loved ones home to their families or provide closure to those who have suffered unspeakable loss. Since our founding, BAMRU has deployed committed volunteers to countless operations across California. We are able to better serve the community  through the generous support of our donors such as you. BAMRU is a non-profit, all-volunteer 501(c)(3) non-profit organization (Federal ID 23-7098709). We don’t have any paid employees, consultants, contractors, or agents, and our volunteer members donate their own personal time, resources, and gear to serve our community at a moment’s notice. You can make a difference! Our readiness and success depends largely on public donations from people like you.  We pride ourselves on running an efficient and professional operation at a minimal cost. 100% of  your donation will directly support search deployments cost, invaluable training fees, and search equipment. Please consider making a tax-deductible gift today and thank you for your support!"
