subtitle: 'BAMRU monthly General Meetings are where members discuss recent and future
  Unit activities, including trainings and missions. General Meetings are open to
  the public, generally on the third Monday of every month.  [See calendar for dates.]
  We share our expertise and learn from our experiences.  Potential applicants are
  encouraged to attend as many meetings as possible to get to know us and vice versa.
  <br><br>BAMRU also has monthly trainings throughout the year to reinforce member
  skills and train our first-year cohort.  All trainings are led and taught by Unit
  members. Some trainings are open to guests under specific conditions - please see
  the guest policy. BAMRU-only trainings advance core competencies. See below for
  upcoming meetings and trainings and hover over trainings for more information. Asterisks
  * mark the core program for first-year trainees.

  desc: We will cover the theory of being Duty Officer (what needs to be done during
    any DO shift, DO-ing during a training, what needs to be done in the ramp up for
    a search, etc), and the practice of DO-ing (how do we accomplish all of these
    things with the tools we have, like bamru.net). For new and experienced DOs alike!
