  BAMRU monthly General Meetings are where members discuss recent and future Unit activities, including trainings and missions. General Meetings are open to the public, generally on the third Monday of every month.  [See calendar for dates]. We share our expertise and learn from our experiences.  Potential applicants are encouraged to attend as many meetings as possible to get to know us and vice versa. 
  <br><br>BAMRU also has monthly trainings throughout the year to reinforce member skills and train our first-year cohort.  All trainings are led and taught by Unit members. Some trainings are open to guests under specific conditions - please see the guest policy. BAMRU-only trainings advance core competencies. See below for upcoming meetings and trainings and hover over trainings for more information.
  Asterisks * mark the core program for first-year trainees.
