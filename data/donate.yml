      When a member of our community goes missing, it’s hard to imagine the immense effort that goes into bringing that person back to their family. Our purpose is to ensure that we bring loved ones home to their families or provide closure to those who have suffered unspeakable loss. Since our founding, BAMRU has deployed committed volunteers to countless operations across California.

  - name: BAMRU members are all volunteers
    text: >
      We have no paid employees, consultants, contractors or agents - all of our members are volunteers who donate their own personal time, personal gear, and personal contributions. Every dollar donated goes directly to serving the community through trainings, equipment, and deployment.
