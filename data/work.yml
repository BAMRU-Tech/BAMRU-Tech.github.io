      BAMRU is a part of the San Mateo County’s Sheriff’s Office, Homeland Security Division, Emergency Services Bureau / Office of Emergency Services [LINK] but can be activated for operations anywhere in California. Places we train include but are not limited to the Santa Cruz mountains, Yosemite, and throughout the Sierra mountains to prepare for the variety of conditions we can encounter.

      We are an all-volunteer 501(c) (3) non-profit organization (Federal ID 23-7098709). Our members volunteer their own time and absorb personal equipment expenses for training and searches. Through the generous support from the San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office and generous donors like you, we are able to acquire team rescue equipment. No payment is expected from those who benefit from our services although donations are welcome and greatly appreciated.
