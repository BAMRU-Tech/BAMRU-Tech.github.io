  - name: We are a non-profit volunteer organization
    text: >
      The unit has been an independent, 501(c)3 non-profit corporation for over 35 years with an elected board of directors. We are proud of our affiliation with the San Mateo County (California) Sheriff's Emergency Services Bureau. The San Mateo county Sherrif's Office supports us by replacing most but not all of worn or retired equipment. The unit's expenses are modest, and include truck insurance and maintenance, replacement and updating of rescue equipment, 24-hour status and emergency phone numbers, and communication and administrative costs.

      BAMRU members are experienced backpackers, climbers, mountaineers, and skiers. Our experience allows us to work safely and comfortably in challenging and hazardous wilderness situations. BAMRU members live all over the Bay Area, from Marin to Santa Cruz and from San Francisco to Contra Costa County. We particularly welcome people who live in our home county of San Mateo.

  - name: We specialize in technical rescue
    text: >
      As a technical rescue team, BAMRU has the skills necessary for low- and high-angle rescue operations. But beyond that, BAMRU members strive to advance their skills in all search and rescue disciplines such as tracking, search operation management, and wilderness medicine. As an MRA team, BAMRU must undergo annual recertification in rock rescue, winter operations, and general search techniques.
