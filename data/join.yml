In addition, your application must be accompanied with (1) certification in basic life support (BLS) CPR from the American Red Cross, or the American Heart Association; (2) proof of current Basic First Aid; and (3) certification of FEMA IS-100 (available online).

      Once accepted, trainees are expected to complete an extensive skills certification checklist (the "packet") within 2 years. You will be expected to attend monthly meetings and trainings to acquire skills and familiarize yourself with team procedures and to build effective working relationships with other members. Trainees are eligible to go on operations on a case-by-case basis.

      The time commitment to becoming a BAMRU member is large. Trainings are typically full weekends or long (3-day) weekends. Callouts come at inconvenient times and can require you to change or cancel your plans on short notice. It is essential that you have a work and family life that can accommodate these demands. BAMRU is not for everyone and there are others ways to be a search and rescue volunteer. The San Mateo Sheriff's Office SMCSAR contributes to many search and rescue operations. We encourage interested individuals to explore other local teams to find the best fit.
