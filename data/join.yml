You will need good physical conditioning to perform well on long days, sometimes with little sleep.

      Before applying to become a trainee, guests must attend at least two BAMRU meetings and two trainings, one of which must be SAR Basic (April). Guests may then be invited to submit an application form and interview with the selection committee. Your application must be accompanied with (1) certification in basic life support (BLS) CPR from the American Red Cross, or the American Heart Association; (2) proof of current Basic First Aid; and (3) certification of FEMA IS-100 (available online). Most of our members come with extensive outdoor experience.

    text: >
      The time commitment to becoming a BAMRU member is large. It involves hard work, sleep deprivation, and substantial disruption to your schedule. You must have the ability, willingness, and flexibility to respond to searches on short notice 24/7 (trainees can go on operations on a case-by-case basis). Trainees are expected to attend monthly meetings and participate in all the core trainings to become familiar with team procedures and to build effective working relationships with other members.  You will be expected to have your own personal outdoor gear and the skills to use them. To persevere as a mountain rescue volunteer, you will need the support of your loved ones, and your workplace.

  - name: What trainings should I come to?
    text: > 
      For guests who are serious about joining BAMRU, we encourage you to participate in Mock Search and SAR Basic training. Attending these trainings and general meetings is the best way to learn about BAMRU, meet BAMRU members, acquire useful search-and-rescue skills, and prepare yourself to apply to join the Unit. Tracking, Medical, and Snow camping are also available to guests if there is room.  

  - name: When are applications due?
    text: >
      There is one recruitment cycle per year to select that year’s cohort of trainees. Applications are typically due shortly after SAR basic in April.  The new trainees begin the core training program over the next year and will have an extensive list of skill sign-offs to complete (the infamous “packet”). Check the calendar for actual dates. For more information, please contact our recruiting officer at the email below.
