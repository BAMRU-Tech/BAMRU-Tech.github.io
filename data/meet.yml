  - name: Peninsula Meeting
    text: >
      Our Peninsula meetings are in Redwood City in either of two adjacent buildings (455 County Center Room 101, or 400 County Center in the Hall of Justice and Records, Jury Assembly Room in basement). Convenient parking is available at the county garage. Look for a BAMRU member in a red jacket to let you through the locked entrance (37.488584, -122.23053). Please arrive promptly (early is on-time) as you may not be able to get in otherwise.
