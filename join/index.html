All new members begin their BAMRU journey as trainees, which lasts 1-2 years or more.</p>

        <h2>Applying to be a Trainee</h2>
        <p>The minimum requirement to join BAMRU is to be an experienced backpacker aged 18&#43;, able to plan and execute a multi-day Sierra backpacking trip, and have it not be a big deal. You will need good physical conditioning to perform well on long days, sometimes with little sleep.</p>

          <h4>Come to a General Meeting</h4>
          <p>If you would like to learn more about how you can become involved in BAMRU, come to a General Meeting shown on the calendar. All guests are invited to stand and introduce themselves. If you have specific questions, feel free to write to us.

          <h4>Come to a Guest-friendly Training</h4>
          <p>Before applying to become a trainee, guests must attend at least two BAMRU meetings and two trainings, one of which must be SAR Basic (April). Guests may then be invited to fill out and submit the application form (April) and be interviewed by the recruitment committee. In addition, your application must be accompanied with (1) certification in basic life support (BLS) CPR from the American Red Cross, or the American Heart Association; (2) proof of current Basic First Aid; and (3) certification of FEMA IS-100 (available online).

          <h4>What can I expect as a BAMRU trainee?</h4>
          <p>Once accepted, trainees are expected to complete an extensive skills certification checklist (the &#34;packet&#34;) within 2 years. You will be expected to attend monthly meetings and trainings to acquire skills and familiarize yourself with team procedures and to build effective working relationships with other members.  Aside from specialized technical rock rescue gear, members are expected to have their own personal outdoor gear and skills to use them. Trainees are eligible to go on operations on a case-by-case basis.

          <h4>What does BAMRU expect from you?</h4>
          <p>The time commitment to becoming a BAMRU member is large. Search and rescue entails hard physical labor, sleep deprivation, and substantial disruption to your schedule. You must have the ability, willingness, and flexibility to respond to operational call-outs on short notice (sometimes in the middle of the night), as well as commit time to monthly meetings and trainings that take a whole weekend. To perservere as a mountain rescue volunteer, you will need the support of your loved ones, and your workmates. BAMRU is not for everyone and there are others ways to be a search and rescue volunteer.
